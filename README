An automated way to make customized LaTeX documents.
My use of this has been limited to homework in math,
computer science, and electrical engineering courses.

Compile HomeworkCompiler.cpp with g++ and run
$ ./a.out [your specification file]

Use the script file (modified for your purposes, of course),
to move the newly-generated .tex file to where you want it.
